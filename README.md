# Mt-Nightmare

This is a game about a person (WW1 vet?) who washes ashore to a strange island port with a mysterious mountain. The player becomes indebted after being rescued. The player can try fishing but soon realizes that is not how to make money. They need to go to the mine. Jewels can be sold to the black marketer and the ores to the mining company. The mining company will punish you if they find jewels that you did not surrender to them. Father Crowley will buy the artifacts.

Cthulhu rests under the mountain in the ocean. Kill it, help it or try your best to ignore it.

The player is foreman and if they don't mine for the milestone, no one will. But the more they do the milestone, the more others will too. Gotta keep up the morale.
